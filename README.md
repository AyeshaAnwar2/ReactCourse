React is a library which means its flow is in our hand we can make files anywhere in it and can work on our will
but in the frameworks there is already built in setup which we can not deny and work acordingly and angular is a framework and react is library

in react the firstly the index.html file executed and the all code written in the app.jsx is visible in root div in index.html through the main.jsx
2ndly the main file executed and then app.jsx and others

files name should be start from capital letter because it distaungius between tags and file

jsx stands for javaScript xml

if you make anoter files means components you have to import them

dependices are those libraries on whichh your project run means react
and devdependencies are development dependencies means we do developmet because of these dev dependencies

package.json include the details of our project and package-lock.json include the nested details of our project
vite.congig.js file include the configration of vite as we can change the host from 5173 to other but have to mentoin theere
eslint.config.js is used as the ecama script of js where we can make our own rules
node modules include the libraries of react

<!-- components -->

component is just a small part of the large thing and there can be sub-components also exists
its start from the capital letter and are like html tags can be self closed
we can make components acording to our demand as App.jsx is also a componetn

import export in react are important , when we make a component or any function and want to use in other files so we use export in that file where we make component and use export where we want to use that component . export is witten as export default 'component name', we use default only one time in file for other components to export we simply use export with function declaration
import is used as (import App from './App.jsx') of the default export component and for the non default import is used in curly braces
